I, Andrew Himebaugh, will be continuing development. Code is commented and documented to the extent necessary

This was a project created during my FYRE program after Freshman Year. It seems as though some of the documentation has gone MIA, whether that was from partners or otherwise. The intent of this program was to aid University Staff in examining grading trends among students, specifically algorithmically examining their entire college career. This was intended to allow insights, recommendations, and course/program modifications to be made, making professors and students lives hopefully easier or more fair.
